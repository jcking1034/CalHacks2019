        <b>Research:</b> "Walter Burke Barbe and colleagues proposed three 
        learning modalities (often identified by the acronym VAK)." These 
        include the Visualising, Auditory, and Kinesthetic modalities. We 
        want to develop a site that allows a user to search for terms, and 
        have the results be presented according to their preferred learning 
        modality. Our product is named Sift, which references the "sifting" 
        of information. It is also an acronym for "Styles in Finding Things."
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Audience:</b> Our audience are college students that don't learn 
        well in traditional classroom lecture environments, or want to conduct 
        further research on topics that accomodate to their particular 
        learning styles.
